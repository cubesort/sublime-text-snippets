# Sublime Text Snippets

## Summary

These are the snippets I use in Sublime Text 3 (ST). They can come in handy when coding. The biggest advantage of using ST snippets instead of tools such as TextExpander is that ST snippets respect indentation. Besides, ST snippets are more configurableâ€“for example, individual snippet can be set to only expand in a certain language.

I'll add new snippets as I learn more. 

## Usage

To use the snippets, simply put the snippet files in ST's User folder or its any subfolder. For ST 3 on OS X, the default path is `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` (substitute USERNAME with system's current username).

The snippets in the `default` folder will replace the default snippets with the same name when put on the top level of packages, `/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/LANGUAGENAME`.
