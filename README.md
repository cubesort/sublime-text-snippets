# Sublime Text Snippets

## Summary

These are the snippets I use in Sublime Text 3. They can come in handy when coding. The biggest advantage of using Sublime Text's snippets instead of text expansion apps such as TextExpander is that Sublime Text's snippets respect indentation. They are also more configurable–for example, individual snippet can be set to only expand in specified languages.

I'll add new ones as I learn more.

## Usage

To use the snippets, simply put the snippet files in Sublime Text's `User` folder or any of its subfolders. For Sublime Text 3 on OS X, the `User` folder can be accessed via menu bar: `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Browse Packages…`.

The snippets in the `default` folder can be used to replace the default snippets of the same name when put on the top level of packages folders.
